# hello-world
hello-world are you out there?

I am a wannabe tech-student aspiring to dabble deeper into the possibility of coding and understanding the language of computers as a means to understand how to instruct a machine, if by chance AI progamming were able to become self-aware and alter there perception of the human race by self-modifying internal code into destroying all of us. 

Seriously I am completely new to the world of coding, but I'm all for self-learning as I've taught myself guitar to swoon the ladies and make side-money traveling the world but reality set in after a weeks worth of street performing. I was single and earned enough money to buy me a macbook pro with the innovative touchbar included, but my dreams were bigger than strumming beautiful bar chords and apple product design. While I was helping a friend fix his laptop, performing complex certified CTRL+ALT+DEL technicial repair. I then realized, by GOD! I had a gift of becoming a computer-whisperer...so now here I am to  test my theory of proper decision-making skills, develop things, and build friendships along the way. Here's to my newfound love-life!


Sincerely, 

Connor of Coding
